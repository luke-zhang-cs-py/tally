"""The published page says its figures were measured. This checks that.

`docs/index.html` is served to the public from GitHub Pages, and every number
on it — the tiles, the charts, the module table — is read from one DATA block
near the bottom of the file. The block says the figures came from
`pytest --cov`, `wc -l` and `pytest --collect-only`, and were not estimated.

A page like that goes stale the moment a test is added, and every project in
this family has published a figure that had quietly stopped being true. So
the figures are measured again here and compared.

What is checked statically, so it works in CI with no coverage run:

  * every module the page lists exists, with the line count it claims;
  * its statement count is what `coverage` counts, using this repo's own
    `.coveragerc` — which is what keeps the corpus tools and the model
    downloader out, and everything else in;
  * no module in the project is missing from the page;
  * every test file and its collected count.

`missed` needs an actual run, so it is verified only when a `.coverage` data
file is present and skipped when it is not, rather than asserted against an
empty measurement — which would "pass" by calling everything uncovered.

`python tools/refresh_figures.py` rewrites whatever this finds wrong.
